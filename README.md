Azure BIM to Robot Pipeline ‚Äì End-to-End Orchestration
Overview
This repository contains the complete multi-phase implementation of the Azure BIM to Digital Twin & Robotic Task Simulation Pipeline.
The system demonstrates an end-to-end workflow starting from a Building Information Model (BIM) in IFC/Revit format, converting it to an Azure Digital Twin, using an LLM (Azure OpenAI) for Chain-of-Thought construction task planning, and executing the tasks in ROS2 & Gazebo robotic simulations.

The pipeline is modular, with each phase building on the previous one.

üìÇ Repository Structure
Phase	Folder	Description
Phase 1-2	Phase 1-2	BIM to Digital Twin Conversion (Phase 1) and LLM Task Orchestration Layer (Phase 2). Converts BIM models into Azure Digital Twins, stores them in Azure Blob Storage, and uses Azure OpenAI to generate structured task plans.
Phase 3	Phase 3	Robotic Task Simulation. Integrates Azure PromptOrchestrator with ROS2 & Gazebo to simulate multi-robot construction workflows using LLM-driven multi-step reasoning.
Phase 4	(Pending)	Automation & Orchestration. Will use Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and IoT Hub to automate triggering of LLM reasoning and robotic execution based on Digital Twin changes.
Phase 5	(This repository)	Version Control & DevOps. Full GitHub repository with documentation, deployment scripts, and test data for all completed phases.

üöÄ Pipeline Workflow
Phase 1 ‚Äì BIM to Digital Twin Conversion

Convert IFC/Revit BIM models into DTDL-compliant Azure Digital Twin models.

Store models in Azure Blob Storage.

Ingest models into Azure Digital Twins Explorer.

Phase 2 ‚Äì LLM Task Orchestration

Use Azure OpenAI with Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate detailed, structured task plans.

Output JSON-formatted plans compatible with robotic control systems.

Phase 3 ‚Äì Robotic Task Simulation

Simulate multi-robot construction workflows in Gazebo.

Fetch reasoning-driven task plans from Azure PromptOrchestrator.

Execute tasks in real-time with telemetry feedback to Azure.

Phase 4 ‚Äì Automation & Orchestration (Planned)

Trigger task generation and simulation automatically when Digital Twin states change.

Integrate IoT telemetry dashboards for monitoring.

Phase 5 ‚Äì Version Control & DevOps

Maintain complete infrastructure and application code in GitHub.

Provide clear documentation, run instructions, and test data.
