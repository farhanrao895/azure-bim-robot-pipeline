# Azure BIM to Robot Pipeline â€“ End-to-End Orchestration

## Overview
This repository contains the complete multi-phase implementation of the **Azure BIM to Digital Twin & Robotic Task Simulation Pipeline**.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow starting from a Building Information Model (BIM) in IFC/Revit format, converting it to an **Azure Digital Twin**, using an **LLM (Azure OpenAI)** for **Chain-of-Thought** construction task planning, and executing the tasks in **ROS2 & Gazebo** robotic simulations.  
It also includes **IoT telemetry dashboards** for real-time monitoring of robotic activities.

The pipeline is modular, with each phase building on the previous one.

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Workflow

### Phase 1 â€“ BIM to Digital Twin Conversion
- Convert IFC/Revit BIM models into DTDL-compliant Azure Digital Twin models.  
- Store models in Azure Blob Storage.  
- Ingest models into Azure Digital Twins Explorer.

### Phase 2 â€“ LLM Task Orchestration
- Use Azure OpenAI with **Chain-of-Thought** prompting to generate detailed, structured task plans.  
- Output JSON-formatted plans compatible with robotic control systems.

### Phase 3 â€“ Robotic Task Simulation
- Simulate multi-robot construction workflows in **Gazebo**.  
- Fetch reasoning-driven task plans from **Azure PromptOrchestrator**.  
- Execute tasks in real time with telemetry feedback to Azure.

### Phase 4 â€“ Automation & Orchestration
- Integrate IoT telemetry dashboards for monitoring robotic activity in real time.

### Phase 5 â€“ Version Control & DevOps
- Maintain complete infrastructure and application code in GitHub.  
- Provide clear documentation, run instructions, and test data.

## ðŸ“œ How to Run Each Phase

- **Phase 1-2:** See [Phase 1-2/README.md](./Phase%201-2/README.md) for detailed setup and execution instructions.  
- **Phase 3:** See [Phase 3/README.md](./Phase%203/README.md) for complete instructions on running the ROS2 & Gazebo simulation with PromptOrchestrator.  
- **Phase 4:** See [Phase 4/README.md](./Phase%204/README.md) for instructions on running the IoT telemetry dashboard.

ðŸ“Œ Code Availability
This repository contains two full runnable codebases:

Phase 1â€“2 complete code â†’ Located in the Phase 1-2 folder (.py file) â€” Creates all components for those phases.

Phase 3 complete code â†’ Located in the Phase 3 folder (.py file) â€” Creates and runs the full simulation.

Each can be run independently in their respective folders.
