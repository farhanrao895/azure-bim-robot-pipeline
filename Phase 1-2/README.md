# Phase 1 & Phase 2 â€” Azure BIM to Digital Twin & AI Task Planning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This folder contains the combined code for **Phase 1** and **Phase 2** of the **Azure BIM to Digital Twin & Robotics Automation Pipeline**.  
The system converts BIM models into Azure Digital Twins, stores them in Azure Blob Storage, and uses AI to generate construction task plans for robotic execution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

### **Phase 1 â€” BIM to Digital Twin Conversion**
- Upload IFC/Revit BIM models to Azure Blob Storage.
- Parse BIM models into DTDL-compliant Digital Twin models.
- Create and populate instances in Azure Digital Twins (ADT).

### **Phase 2 â€” AI Task Planning & Orchestration**
- Use Azure OpenAI with PromptOrchestrator to generate step-by-step construction tasks.
- Convert natural language instructions into structured JSON commands for robotics.
- Provide APIs to retrieve robot status and assigned tasks.
