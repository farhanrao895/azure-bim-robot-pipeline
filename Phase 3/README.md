# Phase 3 – PromptOrchestrator Integration for ROS2 & Gazebo

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains the **Phase 3 deliverables** for the **BIM-to-Digital Twin robotic simulation system**.  

In this phase, we integrate **Azure PromptOrchestrator** with **ROS2** and **Gazebo** to enable **LLM-driven multi-step construction task planning** using **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**.

The system simulates a **2-robot construction workflow** inside an **IFC-aligned Digital Twin building** in Gazebo.  
Tasks are fetched from Azure PromptOrchestrator, processed into ROS2 commands, and executed with **real-time telemetry** and **reasoning context**.
